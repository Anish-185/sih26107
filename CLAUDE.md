# SIH26107 — Evidence-Backed AI Assistant for Indian Standards & BIS Services

## What this project is

A polished, reliable hackathon prototype. A user (industry, MSME, startup, student,
or consumer) asks a BIS-related question in natural language and receives:

1. Relevant BIS information
2. Applicable or candidate Indian Standards **only when supported by evidence**
3. A simple explanation
4. "Why this result?" reasoning grounded in retrieved evidence
5. Official BIS sources
6. Useful next steps

## Core principle (do not violate)

This is an **evidence-backed retrieval and explanation system**.

```
natural language
  -> query understanding
  -> BIS knowledge retrieval
  -> evidence ranking
  -> grounded LLM explanation
  -> answer + evidence + next steps
```

**The LLM is NOT the source of truth. Retrieved BIS information is the source of truth.**

## MVP features (exactly these five)

1. BIS Q&A
2. Product -> Standard discovery  **(flagship)**
3. BIS certification guidance
4. BIS-recognized laboratory search
5. Hallmarking / HUID information

Flagship experience: **"Why this result?"** — for Product -> Standard queries, explain
why a candidate standard was retrieved using actual evidence (product category,
material, intended use, or other info present in the retrieved BIS source).

A standard may only be shown as a recommendation if it exists in the retrieved
knowledge base. **Never invent a standard number.**

## Trust & hallucination rules

The system must NEVER invent:

- Indian Standard numbers
- BIS clauses
- certification schemes
- fees
- testing requirements
- laboratory capabilities
- legal requirements
- HUID results
- certification outcomes

If evidence is insufficient, **explicitly communicate uncertainty or abstain** —
do not guess. Distinguish between: verified information, inferred relevance, uncertainty.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS. shadcn/ui only where useful.
- **Backend:** Python + FastAPI.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL.
- **Retrieval:** Start with simple keyword / full-text retrieval. Add semantic/vector
  retrieval **only if** testing shows a meaningful improvement. Do not add vector
  infrastructure just because it sounds advanced.
- **AI:** LLM provider must be replaceable. Do not architect around Claude specifically.
  The LLM understands and explains retrieved information; retrieved BIS evidence is
  the source of truth.

## Scope limits

Hackathon prototype. **DO NOT introduce:** microservices, Kubernetes, Kafka, agent
swarms, multi-agent architecture, custom LLM training, fine-tuning, computer vision,
mobile apps, voice assistants, fake BIS APIs, fake HUID verification, fake laboratory
results, autonomous legal decisions, unnecessary infrastructure, massive scraping
infrastructure.

Prefer the smallest architecture that produces a reliable and impressive demo.

## Engineering rules

1. Inspect the existing repository before changing anything.
2. Preserve useful existing work.
3. Implement only the current milestone. Do not implement future milestones.
4. Do not add dependencies unless necessary.
5. Do not redesign the architecture without a concrete technical reason.
6. Do not refactor unrelated code.
7. Reuse existing patterns where appropriate.
8. Run relevant tests / checks / builds after changes.
9. Never claim something works without verifying it.
10. Prefer deterministic logic for retrieval, ranking, validation, and structured data.
11. Keep the code understandable to a beginner.
12. Do not create abstractions for hypothetical future requirements.
13. Do not create unnecessary files.
14. Do not use subagents for simple inspection, small edits, or straightforward debugging.
15. Parallelize independent tool operations; keep dependent work sequential.

## The developer

A complete beginner. Work incrementally. Explain what changed and why. Do not assume
familiarity with the codebase, the tools, or the frameworks.

## UI design direction

Aesthetic inspired by the *design philosophy* of Supermemory, but the product must
remain an original BIS interface. Do not copy Supermemory branding, logo, content,
or exact layouts.

Feel: minimal, premium, calm, editorial, modern, spacious, intentional, slightly
futuristic, content-first.

Color system:

- warm off-white / cream background
- very dark charcoal / near-black primary text
- muted warm-gray secondary text
- restrained cyan/blue accent

Avoid: purple AI gradients, blue-purple gradients, excessive neon, glassmorphism,
heavy shadows, huge rounded cards, excessive pills, noisy dashboards, decorative clutter.

Prefer: generous whitespace, strong typography, thin subtle borders, minimal surfaces,
small/moderate corner radii, subtle interaction states, precise alignment, editorial
composition. Premium information/research assistant, not a generic AI SaaS dashboard.

## Knowledge base

Prioritize official BIS information. For the prototype, use a **focused curated
dataset** — do not pretend to have complete BIS coverage. Potential categories:
BIS general info, Indian Standards, certification, certification procedures, testing,
laboratories, hallmarking, consumer information, FAQs.

## Development order (do not skip ahead)

| Phase | Name |
|------:|------|
| 1  | Foundation |
| 2  | BIS knowledge base |
| 3  | Retrieval |
| 4  | RAG / AI answers |
| 5  | Product -> Standard |
| 6  | Certification |
| 7  | Laboratories |
| 8  | Hallmarking |
| 9  | Why this result |
| 10 | UI polish |
| 11 | Testing |
| 12 | Demo hardening |
| 13 | Real IMAGE -> OCR |
| 14 | OCR -> declarations -> product -> Indian Standard (this phase) |

*Phase 14 — OCR -> declaration extraction -> product classification -> verified
Indian Standard lookup. `POST /inspection/analyze` now runs the downstream
pipeline after OCR and returns `declaration_stage`, `classification`,
`standard_match` and a `pipeline` stage summary (the old `product` /
`declarations` / `checks` / `status` / `pipeline_stage` fields are gone). New
backend modules, each a single surface: `app/declarations.py` (deterministic
regex/keyword extraction of 14 declaration fields — every `Declaration` keeps its
`source_region_id` + `bbox` + `ocr_confidence` + `method`; FSSAI licence is
extracted but explicitly labelled food-safety, NOT a BIS standard),
`app/classification.py` (deterministic product rules first, local Qwen3-4B strict
-JSON fallback only when rules miss, `REVIEW` if the model is unavailable and no
rule matched — the model classifies, it never emits a standard number: any
standard-ish key or reason fragment is stripped), `app/standards_registry.py`
(loads `data/standards_registry.json` — hand-verified BIS standards only; keyword
-phrase overlap lookup returns the strongest verified match or `REVIEW`, never a
generated IS number; a single generic word cannot match), `app/pipeline.py`
(`run_downstream` — orchestrates the three stages, each isolated so one failure
degrades that stage to `REVIEW` and the rest still run). `app/inspection.py`
wires the pipeline in and converts the dataclasses to `*Out` models;
`app/inspection_api.py` injects `LocalLLM(timeout=45)`. `app/llm.py` now also
reads `LM_STUDIO_BASE_URL` / `LM_STUDIO_MODEL` (with `LLM_*` as fallback).
Registry seed: **IS 18140:2023 — Roasted Bengal Gram — Specification** (verified,
BIS committee FAD 16), IS 14543:2016 / IS 13428:2005 (packaged water). The
`data/knowledge/` BIS Q&A set is untouched and unrelated (it has no food
standards). Frontend: `InspectionView` keeps its exact design and adds a
"Declared fields" panel (click a field -> its OCR box highlights on the image),
an "Applicable Indian Standard" panel (number / title / source link / real
confidence / why-this-match, or a `REVIEW` state), and swaps the `PENDING`
literals in the downstream panel + the left summary for the real stage states.
Legal-metrology PASS/FAIL is still `NEXT`. Tests: `test_declarations.py` (31),
`test_standards_registry.py` (25), `test_classification.py` (21 — stubbed model),
`test_pipeline.py` (30 — end-to-end + degradation + HTTP contract);
`test_inspection_ocr.py` updated for the new response shape. Full suite 108
passed.*

*Phase 13 recap — real image -> OCR. `POST /inspection/analyze` (multipart, field
`image`) decodes the uploaded package image, computes lightweight quality
metrics (blur / brightness / contrast, numpy only), runs local OCR, and returns
the raw OCR regions (`text`, `confidence`, axis-aligned `bbox` + `polygon` in
source pixels, `OCR-NNN` id) plus the joined text. New backend modules:
`app/ocr.py` (engine wrapper — one surface, `run_ocr`), `app/inspection.py`
(models + `InspectionAnalyzer`), `app/inspection_api.py` (router, wired in
`app/main.py`). OCR engine: `rapidocr-onnxruntime` — the PaddleOCR PP-OCRv3
detection/cls/recognition weights run through ONNX Runtime, because PaddlePaddle
publishes no wheels for this Python; models ship in the wheel so OCR is fully
local with no network at inference. NOTHING downstream is done here — the
response's `product` / `declarations` / `checks` / `status` are explicitly
`"Pending extraction"` / `[]` / `"PENDING"`, never invented. The LLM (Qwen3-4B)
is untouched and is not involved in OCR. Frontend: `InspectionView` now runs the
real flow (upload -> `/inspection/analyze` -> OCR workspace with the image, the
overlaid boxes, per-region text/confidence, raw text, quality metrics); an empty
or failed OCR shows an honest empty / error state and never substitutes the old
demo inspection. `mocks.tsx` is unchanged and still backs History / Review /
Dashboard. Tests: `backend/tests/test_inspection_ocr.py` (41 checks — real
engine on synthesised labels, blank image -> zero regions, non-image -> error,
HTTP contract). `backend/tests/test_llm_adapter.py` regression test unchanged.
The deterministic rule engine, declaration extraction and PASS/FAIL remain
future phases.*

*Phase 12 recap: demo hardening. Full clean-shell startup,
frontend<->backend integration and the deterministic demo path
(Product -> Standard -> Why this result -> evidence, LLM-free) were verified
end to end; no white screens, console errors or contract mismatches. One small
fix: `app/llm.py` now raises a short user-facing `LLMError` on an LM Studio HTTP
error / timeout ("LM Studio returned HTTP 400", "could not reach LM Studio
(ReadTimeout)") instead of stringifying the raw httpx exception, which had been
leaking an internal URL and an MDN link into the error callout. Behaviour is
unchanged — still a 503, still no fabricated answer. Regression test:
`backend/tests/test_llm_adapter.py` (15 checks, stubbed `httpx.post`). README
gained a "Demoing" note (lead with the LLM-free Product -> Standard path) and
the authoritative-test command.
Phase 11 recap: testing. No application code changed.
Added `backend/tests/test_rag.py` (dedicated grounded-RAG / `/ask` coverage:
evidence reaches the LLM, abstention makes no LLM call, sources preserved,
`/ask` returns 503 on an LLM outage, no invented standard numbers, system-prompt
trust rules), `backend/tests/test_api_contract.py` (drives the real ASGI app via
`TestClient`: every endpoint's shape + status codes, `limit` bounds -> 422,
malformed body -> 422, an adversarial product sweep proving every returned
`standard_number` exists in the KB), and `backend/tests/test_plain_runners.py`
(a pytest bridge that runs every plain-Python runner as a subprocess and fails
if any exits non-zero — so `python -m pytest -q` is now an authoritative gate,
not just the direct runners). Fake / raising local-model stand-ins keep every
LLM test deterministic and independent of LM Studio.
Phase 10 recap: targeted frontend polish only (no visual-identity change) —
`standardTitle()` helper, "Why this result" hierarchy, calmer timeout/model
error copy.
Phase 9 recap: deterministic "Why this result?" for
Product -> Standard discovery. Phase 9 adds NO new endpoint, NO new retrieval
engine and NO LLM call. The Phase 3 `SearchEngine` already records every scoring
point as a `MatchReason`; `app/product.py` gains a pure function
`explain_candidate(RetrievalResult) -> WhyThisResult` that turns those existing
reasons into a fixed-order list of `signals` plus one plain-language `summary`
("Retrieved as a candidate standard (strong/moderate/weak match) because …").
`strength` mirrors retrieval confidence; the wording never claims legal
applicability. `ProductStandardOutcome` gains a parallel `explanations` list
(empty on abstention) and a standing grounded `note`; `POST /product-standard`
exposes it as `why` on each result (alongside the untouched raw `reasons`).
Frontend: `StandardsView.tsx` shows `result.why.summary` as the lead of the
"Why this result" block, keeping the detailed reason breakdown beneath. Tests:
`backend/tests/test_why_this_result.py` (41 checks).
Phase 8 recap: Hallmarking / HUID information. Phase 8 added
NO new retrieval engine and NO new endpoint: hallmarking / HUID questions go
through the existing deterministic `SearchEngine` + grounded `/ask` pipeline
(`app/rag.py`). The curated KB's `hallmarking` category (plus hallmarking FAQs
and consumer pages) supplies the evidence; it contains no concrete HUID value to
leak. `rag.py`'s shared `SYSTEM_PROMPT` gained rule 6: never claim to verify /
authenticate a specific physical item's HUID, hallmark, licence or registration,
and never output a HUID not present in the supplied context. Frontend:
`frontend/src/features/HallmarkingView.tsx` (route `/hallmarking`, nav
"Hallmarking") calls `api.ask` and renders via the shared `<GroundedAnswer/>`;
it states plainly it does not run live HUID verification. Tests:
`backend/tests/test_hallmarking.py` (37 checks). No individual-lab / no
fabrication rules carry over from Phase 7.
Phase 7 recap: BIS-recognized laboratory search (`app/laboratory.py`,
`POST /laboratory-search`) — runs the Phase 3 `SearchEngine` over
`laboratories` / `testing`, never names a laboratory (KB has no lab records),
points to BIS's official lists + the LIMS portal, abstains with a fixed message
when no evidence is retrieved.
Phase 6 recap: certification guidance (`app/certification.py`,
`POST /certification-guidance`). Phase 5 recap: Product -> Standard discovery
(`app/product.py`, `POST /product-standard`).

Frontend (MetrIQ): `frontend/` — React + TS + Vite + Tailwind v4. The product
is presented as "MetrIQ — AI-Assisted Legal Metrology Inspection". Standards,
Certification, Laboratories, Hallmarking and the header health dot call the real
API. The Inspection tab is real end to end through Phase 14: upload ->
`/inspection/analyze` -> OCR + declarations + product classification + verified
Indian Standard. History / Review / Dashboard still run on clearly labelled
placeholder data (`frontend/src/mocks.tsx`) — the legal-metrology PASS/FAIL rule
engine and the officer report are not built yet. Run: backend on :8000, then
`cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev` (proxies `/api` -> :8000).

Phases 1–14 are complete. The remaining work is the legal-metrology rule engine
(deterministic PASS / FAIL / REVIEW over the extracted declarations + the matched
standard) and the officer review / report surface.

Only implement the current milestone. Do not start a new phase without being asked.

### Knowledge base

`data/knowledge/` holds one JSON array file per category. `KnowledgeItem`
(`backend/app/knowledge/schema.py`) is a flat structure that maps 1:1 to a future
PostgreSQL row. Rules: unique slug IDs, non-sample items need a `source_url`,
`indian_standards` items need a `standard_number` (unique within that category),
`verified` items need `source_url` + `last_verified`. Validate with
`./.venv/bin/python scripts/check_knowledge.py`.

Phase 2B populated it from official BIS pages only (`bis.gov.in`,
`services.bis.gov.in`). Indian Standards records come mostly from the BIS "Products
under Compulsory Certification" lists (Scheme I / Scheme II), so they carry BIS's
own product description, not the verbatim catalogue title — each record's `content`
states this. Do not treat the dataset as complete BIS coverage.

### Retrieval (Phase 3)

`app/retrieval/engine.py` — `SearchEngine.search(query)` returns a `SearchOutcome`
with ranked `RetrievalResult`s. Scoring is a transparent weighted sum over
`title` / `keywords` / `standard_number` / `category` / `document_name` /
`reference` / `content`; every point is recorded as a `MatchReason` (for the future
"Why this result?"). Confidence (`high` / `medium` / `low` / `none`) comes from the
top hit's score plus query-term coverage; all weights and thresholds live in
`RetrievalConfig`. `abstained` is true (and `results` empty) when nothing matches.
The LLM must never generate the match reasons — retrieval produces them.
