"""Checks for Phase 5 Product -> Standard discovery.

Plain Python, no test framework (matches tests/test_retrieval.py). Run with:

    cd backend
    ./.venv/bin/python tests/test_product.py

Exit code 0 = all checks passed, 1 = something failed.

Runs against the real verified knowledge base in data/knowledge/. No fake BIS
facts are introduced.
