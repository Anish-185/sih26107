"""Make `python -m pytest -q` an authoritative gate for the plain-Python suites.

Most test files in this directory are plain-Python runners: their `check()`
helper prints PASS/FAIL and sets an exit code in `main()`, but the individual
`test_*` functions never `assert`, so pytest would report them as "passed" even
when an internal check fails.

This module closes that gap: it runs every other `tests/test_*.py` file as its
own subprocess (exactly the "authoritative" way they are meant to be run) and
fails if any of them exits non-zero. Running each suite in a fresh process also
keeps their module-global PASS/FAIL counters from contaminating each other.
