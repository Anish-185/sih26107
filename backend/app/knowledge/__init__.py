"""BIS knowledge base: schema and loader.

The knowledge base is the source of truth for BIS information. Every item must be
traceable to an official source (or be clearly marked as a non-official sample).

Phase 2A only defines the structure, validation, and a loader. Retrieval, RAG, and
the LLM come later and are expected to depend on this package.
