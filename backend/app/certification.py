"""BIS certification guidance (Phase 6).

This module does NOT decide what the law requires. It:

  1. identifies the product / Indian Standard the question is about, reusing the
     Phase 5 ProductStandardFinder (deterministic),
  2. retrieves certification-related BIS evidence with the Phase 3 SearchEngine
     (deterministic),
  3. checks whether that evidence is strong enough to say anything useful,
  4. only then asks the local LLM to explain ONLY that evidence,
  5. returns a structured answer together with its BIS sources.

If the knowledge base does not hold enough certification evidence, the service
abstains instead of guessing.

   steps, required documents, testing requirements, or legal obligations. If the

3. Keep this distinction explicit: an Indian Standard existing for a product is
   NOT the same as BIS certification being mandatory. Only say certification is
   mandatory or compulsory for a product if the evidence says so.
4. You explain the evidence. You do NOT make the final legal or enforcement
   decision. Where appropriate, suggest the user confirm with BIS.
5. Be concise and directly address the question.
